## About 
This project is built with Vanilla JavaScript with a Node.js backend, as for storing data it uses the lightweight NeDB. It aims to provide a pentest dashboard where it allows users to create and manage penetration testing projects. 

* It contains a checklist template that follows the [DNGP](https://desecsecurity.com/curso/novo-pentest-profissional) methodology, allowing the user to track all tests that has been performed.
* All added vulnerabilities are displayed on the front-page along with their risk level and status.
* There is a counter that keeps track of number of vulnerabilities according to their risk level.
* The details tab displays all vulnerabilities in detail with images uploaded by the user.
* All information gathered can be easily viewed, which facilitates when creating reports. 

##### Future Implementations
The following are few features that stil in progress and I hope to implement in the future

* Adding the option to switch the interface language to English, as currently it is in Portuguese.
* Editable checklist, so the user can create their own methodology without having to go the Ejs file to change that.
* Authentication and other security measures
* Storing data into [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqKuKBhCxARIsACf4XuFS3Iuwl0oAQdEeYq1X2q-eVHifnTGW8UUtx3So-_TxEtGWs2kR9p0aAiNAEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
* Generating reports in pdf


## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running. 
Note: if you have the latest Node.js installed you can skip the second step.

### Installing dependencies

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/spinolaju/pentest-dashboard.git
   ```
2. Install Node.js
 <br>It can be downloaded here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Run Node Server

```sh
   set DEBUG='pentest:*'; npm start
   ```

## Usage

* Main Menu - New project or Open an existing project

 * Creating a new project

 * Selecting an existing project

* Dashboard - Displays details of the project, number of vulnerabilities, number of vulnerabilities classified by their risk level along with a table that presents in a brief way all vulnerabilities registered, its status and its risk level.

* Checklist - Tests performed by the user can be ticked. Each one of these tests allow the user to add any vulnerabilties or evidences that they found. 

 * Vulnerabilities / Adding vulnerabilties

 * Evidences / Adding Evidences

 * Notes - Each checklist item contains a button to add notes. This is a space where the user adds some notes that pontentially act as a guide, they can be code snippets or any resources that the user find useful when performing that specific test. These notes are not attached to a particular project, therefore they can be viewed and managed across all projects.
